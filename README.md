## Frequently Asked Questions

**What's the difference between residential and ISP proxies?**

Residential proxies route traffic through real home internet connections, appearing virtually identical to legitimate user traffic while being slower and less consistent. ISP proxies combine residential IP addresses assigned by internet service providers with high-speed datacenter hosting, providing faster performance than pure residential while maintaining better anonymity than datacenter-only proxies. ISP proxies excel for use cases requiring persistent identity and speed, while residential proxies prioritize anonymity and detection avoidance.

**How do I choose the right proxy provider for my use case?**

Evaluate specific needs: speed requirements, geographic targeting precision, concurrent request capacity, budget constraints, and success rate thresholds. Enterprise applications prioritizing reliability and support align better with premium providers like Bright Data or Oxylabs. Cost-sensitive operations benefit from budget alternatives like Rayobyte or PacketStream. Specialized requirements like AI training or real-time speed optimization point toward next-generation platforms like Nimble or Massive.

**Are residential proxies legal for web scraping?**

Residential proxies themselves are legal tools; legality depends on target websites' terms of service and local regulations. Public data collection generally receives legal protection, while scraping protected content or violating terms of service may create liability. Reputable providers implement customer vetting and refuse clearly abusive uses, while users bear responsibility for compliant operation within applicable laws.

## Conclusion

The residential proxy market matured dramatically through 2025, with providers now competing on performance, features, and ethical standards rather than simply network size. **[ProxyShare](#proxyshare)** stands out as the top choice for balanced requirements, combining massive IP scale with competitive pricing and user-friendly interfaces suitable for market research, brand monitoring, and general web scraping.
